# Cross compile aarch64 makepkg drone.io plugin

The goal of this repository is to provide [drone.io plugins](http://plugins.drone.io/) performing a cross-compile Archlinux [makepkg](https://www.archlinux.org/pacman/makepkg.8.html) for aarch64 architecture.

To use it, read the [drone.io docs](https://readme.drone.io) or run `docker run -it mydatakeeper/drone-aarch64-makepkg`.
